# Configuration

```go
xorOptions = []uint{0}
hashes     = []string{"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff", "00000000000000000000000000000000"}
adderTypes     = []string{"counter_chain", "dot_matrix"}
stepVariations = makeRange(16, 32)
satSolvers = []string{CRYPTOMINISAT, KISSAT, CADICAL, GLUCOSE, MAPLESAT}
MAX_TIME = 5000
MAX_INSTANCES_COUNT = 50
```

# Notes

- Got valid results for MD4-x, where x ranges from 16 to 31.
- Kissat performed the best, but CaDiCaL was close.
- Only Glucose and Kissat were able to invert MD4-31 within the time limit.
- CryptoMiniSAT performed the worst. Maybe it'd do better with XOR encodings and multi-threading?
- Keeping the max. instance count to 50 kept the memory usage down and reduced intensity of the harder problems from bottlenecking the easier ones.
